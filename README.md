# Vue.js Introduction APP

This repo is a part of [Vue Storefront](https://github.com/DivanteLtd/vue-storefront) training but it's also useful as a standlone introduction to Vue and Vuex.

## How to use it?

The best way to learn from this repo is to read the application files in order. In each file we are using new Vue concept.


In `src/main.js' you can choose if you want to run Vue app without or with state management by uncommenting entry point for each of them.

The recommended order of reading the project files is:
1. `src/vue-basics/main.js`
2. `src/vue-basics/App.vue`
3. `src/vue-basics/router.js`
4. `src/vue-basics/pages/Listing.vue`
5. `src/vue-basics/components/PostTile.vue`
5. `src/vue-basics/components/Post.vue`

## Setup

````npm install````

````npm run dev````
